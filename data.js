var data = [{
	"objections": [
		"I don't want to get stuck in a contract.",
		"I'm not a huge fan of contracts, so I won't be able to buy your product."],
	"answer": "Offer a month-by-month or quarter-by-quarter payment instead of asking for a year or more commitment up front."
}, {
	"objections": [
		"Your product's too expensive.",
		"What! A 50k price tag? That's way to expensive for me."],
	"answer": "Be careful. The moment you start focusing on price as a selling point, you reduce yourself to a transactional middleman. Instead, circle back to the product's value."
}, {
	"objections": [
		"We literally have no money right now to buy your product.",
		"Our company doesn't have the revenue to justify this purchase."],
	"answer": "If the company really is small right now, track their growth and see how you can help your prospect get to a place where your offering would fit into their business."
}, {
	"objections": [
		"We're already using a competitive product.",
		"It seems like you are similar to this other competitive product that we use!"],
	"answer": "Just because a prospect is working with a competitor doesn't mean they're happy with them. Probe into the relationship: Why did they choose this service? What's working well? What's not? Pay special attention to complaints that could be solved with your product."
}, {
	"objections": [
		"I'm locked into a contract with a competitor.",
		"I wish you came by earlier, we just signed a contract with your competitor!"],
	"answer": "See if you can come up with a creative discount to offset the cost of breaking a contract early, or demonstrate ROI that will make up for the sunk cost."
}, {
	"objections": [
		"We don't have any budget left this year.",
		"I love your product, but when I presented it to the CEO, she said we don't have room in the budget at t."],
	"answer": "Either help your prospect secure budget from executives to buy now, or arrange up a follow-up call for when they expect funding to return."
