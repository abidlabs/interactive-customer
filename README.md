The Simulated Customer Game
===

Simulated Customer pretends to be a reluctant customer that you are selling to, so that you 
can practice your selling skills. The idea is that the customer presents different
objections so you can learn to [handle objections]("https://www.carew.com/laer-bonding-process/).

Simulated Customer was written by Abubakar Abid, founder and CEO of [Gradio](www.gradio.app).
It is forked, and heavily borrows, from iPG which was written by James Cunningham and Colin Hayhurst.

Sources of objections and answers include:
