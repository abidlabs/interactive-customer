Interactive Customer
===

Interactive customer simulates a customer that you are selling to, so that you 
can practice your selling skills. The idea is that the customer presents different
objections so you can practice handling objections.

Interactive customer was written by Abubakar Abid, founder and CEO of [Gradio](www.gradio.app).
It is forked from, iPG which was written by James Cunningham and Colin Hayhurst.
